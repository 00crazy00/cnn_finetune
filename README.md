# finetune_neural_network

Starter Scripts to fine-tune Convolutional Neural Networks in Keras

Implementation is available for the following CNN models:

VGG16 - vgg16.py
VGG19 - vgg19.py
GoogLeNet (InceptionV1) - googlenet.py
InceptionV3 - inception_v3.py
ResNet - resnet.py

ImageNet pretrained data should be stored in the `cache` directory. The directory is currently empty. Follow the link provided in the individual model files to dowload the data into this directory.
